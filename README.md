htmloptimize
============

An experimental Joomla! 1.5/2.5 plugin to remove HTML comments, double new lines, double carriage returns, tabs and other non-catastrophic optimization. The goal is to reduce the rendered page size while maintaining readability of code.

Initial test show a document reduction ranging from 2% to just over 12%.

NOTE: This plugin does not attempt to optimize CSS, JS or other page assets. It only processes the page markup.
